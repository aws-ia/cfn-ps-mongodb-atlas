.Partner Solution architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/mongodb-atlas-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A VPC that spans two Availability Zones. The VPC is configured with public subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets, managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access.*
* A VPC peering connection between your VPC and the MongoDB Atlas VPC.
* A VPC for the MongoDB Atlas project that spans at least three Availability Zones. This includes a fully managed MongoDB Atlas cluster, a database user, and an IP access list entry.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Partner Solution into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#

Deploying Atlas without peering is the simplest deployment option. It skips the VPC resources and creates only MongoDB Atlas resources using MongoDB CloudFormation resource types.
